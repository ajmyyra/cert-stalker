# Program to watch Certstream and notify when something is seen

Cert Stalker is a Node.JS program to watch Certificate Transparency streams through CertStream (https://certstream.calidog.io/) and log matches (and notify you of any matching certificates). It enables you to react to possible phishing attempts against your customers, watch that your Let's Encrypt renewals are processing or to stalk someones subdomains, since somebody thought it was a good idea to show them all through Certificate Transparency streams. Get wildcard certificates.
